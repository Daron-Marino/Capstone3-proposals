## 1. Music Recommeder System Using Spotify data

I'd like to build a recommendation system based on Spotify data. There are several features tied to the dataset that can be used to build out a content-based recommendation system:
* Artists, Acousticness, Danceability, Energy, Liveness, Popularity, etc. 

I'd also like to build a Flask app that can provide recommendations based on an individual's Artist or Genre preference.

Reach: If possible, I'd like to somehow integrate spotify into the flask app so individuals receive links to music in the actual Spotify app along with recommendations.

The data come from boardgamegeek.com, which can be used to build recommdner systems. Similar to my above proposal, I'd like to try out different recommender systems and determine which one works best for this particular dataset.

I'd also like to build out a Flask app that can provide recommendations based on user preference

I'd like top use the Goodreads data to build a recommender system. I would follow the same approach and methodology as the two previous proposals.
