[Link to Data](https://grouplens.org/datasets/hetrec-2011/)

I'd like to build a recommender system based on Last.fm user data. I'd like to try out varying recommender systems (content-based, similarity-based, factorization), and determine which one performs best.

I'd also like to build a Flask app that can provide recommendations based on user preference

The data come from boardgamegeek.com, which can be used to build recommdner systems. Similar to my above proposal, I'd like to try out different recommender systems and determine which one works best for this particular dataset.

I'd also like to build out a Flask app that can provide recommendations based on user preference

I'd like top use the Goodreads data to build a recommender system. I would follow the same approach and methodology as the two previous proposals.
